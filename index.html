<h1>Valentino's Embedded Systems Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Pinned</h2>
<body>Welcome to my portfolio on creative embedded systems and embedded software engineering using ESP32 microcontrollers.
  The site will be updated from now through May 2024 with development progress.
  There will be an emphasis on documentation and sustainability.
  Thanks.</body>

<h2>Generative Art Installation</h2>
<body><i>displayed at Barnard College</i></body>
<br>
<body>For this installation, I chose the first sentence from selected works by Cormac McCarthy: Blood Meridian, The Outer Dark, The Passenger, and Stella Maris.
  Perhaps the greatest author of his century, McCarthy is known for philosophical conversations between mankind and nature, a stark contrast to the glib psychosis of his centurial peers.
  I decided to empower this conversation through the lens of something arguably very unnatural: an ESP32 microcontroller.

  TODO...
