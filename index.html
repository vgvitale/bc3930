<h1>Valentino's Embedded Systems Portfolio</h1>
<h4>(Pinned)</h4>
<body>Welcome to my portfolio on creative embedded systems and embedded software engineering using ESP32 microcontrollers.
  The site will be updated from now through May 2024 with development progress.
  There will be an emphasis on documentation and sustainability.
  Thanks.</body>

<h2>Generative Art Installation</h2>
<body><i>displayed at Barnard College</i></body>
<br>
<br>
<h4>README and code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/vgvitale/vgvitale.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</h4>
<br>
<body>For this installation, I chose the first sentence to be generated from selected works by Cormac McCarthy: Blood Meridian, The Outer Dark, The Passenger, and Stella Maris.
  Perhaps the greatest author of his century, McCarthy is known for philosophical conversations between mankind and nature-a stark contrast to the glib psychosis of his centurial peers.
  I decided to empower this conversation through the lens of something arguably very unnatural: an ESP32 microcontroller.
  <br>

  To specialize this generation to the space, the ESP32 was wrapped in a paper envelope, which allowed the ESP32 to be more easily suspended from the ceiling with fabric thread.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some creative decisions that had to be made were due to the paper envelope: since the envelope was not a perfect fit, how could I better enclose the device?
  Also, how would I turn it on after enclosing the device?
  To address this, I taped down the device into the envelope, and cut small holes into the sides of the envelope, wrapping the string around them like a present.
  Then, I cut a small section of the envelope to allow the "on" button to be reached by scissors.
  <br>
  <br>
  My process was to keep the enclosure minimal and keep the focus on the message being displayed, to lean into the overall goal of the project.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the technical side, some issues arose, namely the battery life. I was only able to get my hands on an approximately 200mAh battery.
  In fact, even this higher capacity battery required a connector conversion, which I performed using shrink  (to prevent a short circuit.)
  However, my device needed closer to a 400-500mAh battery to run for the entire projected 3 hour exhibit.
  To combat this, I turned the display screen to an absolute minimum.
  However, this became an issue during the installation, as the sunlight was much brighter in the room of the installation compared to my testing room.
  <br>
  <br>
  I recommend other artists with a similar hardware setup use either a higher capacity battery, or the sleep mode (included in the code.)
