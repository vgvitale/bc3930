<h1>Valentino's Embedded Systems Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Pinned</h2>
<body>Welcome to my portfolio on creative embedded systems and embedded software engineering using ESP32 microcontrollers.
  The site will be updated from now through May 2024 with development progress.
  There will be an emphasis on documentation and sustainability.
  Thanks.</body>
